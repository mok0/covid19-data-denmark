# Epidemiological data of COVID-19 for Denmark

This archive contains data from [Statens Serum Institut (SSI)][1], an
institution under the auspices of the Danish Ministry of Health.

Most of the data in this repo has been extracted by me by scraping the
official COVID-19 status web page of the [Danish Ministry of
Health][2]. Although the the data is also available from the producer
[Statens Serum Insitut][3] I found that the former web page changes far
less frequently.


## CSV Data File Content

The data contained in the file `covid19-data-denmark.csv` includes the
following columns:

- `day`: days since Monday 2020-02-24, the first day of the week where
  the first COVID-19 cases were first recorded in Denmark.
- `date`: The date in ISO 8601 format.
- `tests_accum`: Accumulated number of performed tests. This data was
   not provided before 2020-05-15.
- `tests_today`: Tests reported on this date. This data was not
   provided before 2020-05-16.
- `tested_accum`: Accumulated number of tested persons. Daily updates
  to this data was not provided before 2020-03-02, the total of all
  tested persons before that (358) are recorded on this day.

- `infected_accum`: Accumulated number of confirmed cases.

- `recovered_accum`: Accumulated number of recoveries.
- `recovered_today`: Persons reported recovered on this date.
- `active`: Active cases. Computed per day using this formula:
  ```infected_accum - recovered_accum - dead_accum```

updated on weekdays and published on [SSI's web page][3].
