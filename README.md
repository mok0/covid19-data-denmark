# Epidemiological data of COVID-19 for Denmark

This archive contains data from [Statens Serum Institut (SSI)][1], an
institution under the auspices of the Danish Ministry of Health.

Most of the data in this repo has been extracted by me by scraping the
official COVID-19 status web page of the [Danish Ministry of
Health][2]. Although the the data is also available from the producer
[Statens Serum Insitut][3] I found that the former web page changes far
less frequently.

June 17, 2020 SSI changed the definition of COVID-19 related
hospitalizations to be defined as hospitalization occurring within 14
days after the first positive test. Furthermore, patients still
hospitalized 90 days after first positive tests are removed from the
statistic. The numbers for hospitalizations (+ ICU, ventilators) have
been updated accordingly.

- `tests_accum`: Accumulated number of performed tests. This data was
   not provided before 2020-05-15.
- `tests_today`: Tests reported on this date. This data was not
   provided before 2020-05-16.
- `tested_accum`: Accumulated number of tested persons. Daily updates
  to this data was not provided before 2020-03-02, the total of all

  COVID-19 pandemic.
- `dead_today`: Number of persons reported dead on this date.
- `recovered_accum`: Accumulated number of recoveries.
- `recovered_today`: Persons reported recovered on this date.
- `active`: Active cases. Computed per day using this formula:
  ```infected_accum - recovered_accum - dead_accum```

- `respirator_change`: Change in number of patients in ventilators since
  the day before.

(*) The data in the `hospitalized_admitted` column is extracted from
the dataset `Newly_admitted_over_time.csv` that can be found in a zip-archive
updated on weekdays and published on [SSIs web page][3].


### vaccinations.csv

This file contains data of COVID-19 vaccinations, extracted from a PDF
file published by SSI on weekdays.

- `day`: days since Monday 2020-02-24, the first day of the week where
  the first COVID-19 cases were first recorded in Denmark.

- `vaccination1_today`: Today's number of first vaccination
- `vaccination2_accum`: Accumulated number of second vaccination
- `vaccination2_today`: Today's number of second vaccination


### private_testing.csv

This file contains data from private testing providers, extracted
from a PDF file published by SSI on weekdays. It is not known how many
of these patients also have been tested in the public testing system.
Indeed it is quite likely that patients with positive antigen test
have their results confirmed by taking a test in the public system,
which is free. Therefore, the data in this table cannot be added to
the data in the file `covid19-data-denmark.csv`.

- `day`: days since Monday 2020-02-24, the first day of the week where
  the first COVID-19 cases were first recorded in Denmark.
- `date`: The date in ISO 8601 format.
- `week`: The ISO week number.
- `tests_pcr_accum`: Performed PCR tests, accumulated
- `tests_pcr_today`: Performed PCR tests, today
- `infected_pcr_accum`: Infected patients found by PCR testing, accumulated
- `infected_pcr_today`: Infected patients found by PCR testing, today
- `tests_ag_accum`: Performed antigen tests, accumulated
- `tests_ag_today`: Performed antigen tests, today
- `infected_ag_accum`: Infected patients found by antigen testing, accumulated
- `infected_ag_today`: Infected patients found by antigen testing, today

### mutant_data.csv

This file contains sequencing data on positive SARS-CoV-2 samples. The
data is extracted from the statistics page of the [Danish Covid-19 Genome Consortium](https://www.covid19genomics.dk).
The data is aggregated per week.

- `day`: The day number of the last day of the week (Sunday). Day zero

        first COVID-19 cases were first recorded in Denmark.
- `year`: The year
- `week`: Week number of the year.
- `variant`: The genome variant.
- `ireg`: The region number.
- `region`: The region name
- `positive`: Number of variant genomes sequenced
- `genomes`: Number samples sequenced
- `cases`: Total number of cases in that region and that week
